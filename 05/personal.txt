Answers
A1.
    The hardest part of this ex was understanding the relationship between any ajax request and the dynamic
    web server. Another thing which was kinda hard to figure out is the querySelector used to find
    the specific to do and use its attributes.
A2.
    Actually once we figured out the entire ajax-webServer communication, the rest (in regards to the functionality)
    was kind of no brainer.
A3.
    The Exs help greatly in understanding the principles of the topic covered in the course. It really does feel
    that this technologies we learned cover a great amount of the technologies currently used in web development.
    Furthermore, a quick into to the html5 and the es6 left us hungry for more.
