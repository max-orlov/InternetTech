TODO ~ When the user is already logged in, redirect him to the todoapp section.

TODO ~ Show 'clear completed' button only when at least one todo is completed.

TODO ~ Check toggle-all checkbox when all the todos are marked as completed (when we mark them one by one it doesn't happen).

TODO ~ Show the number of completed todos (near 'clear completed' button) - see the how the original app acts.

TODO ~ Maybe change the location of the logout button (probably should be in other html zone).

TODO ~ Maybe change errors from alert into an html span/label tag.

TODO ~ Clean and document code of both main.js files.

TODO ~ When we are done, delete unnecessary files, and reorganize the www subtree.

TODO ~ Write personal.txt file.

TODO ~ Write some tests for all the HTTP APIs (test.js).

TODO ~ Write description of the tests (tester.txt).

TODO ~ BONUS - Run the app on top of express js instead of on top of our Ex4 (I added a folder named express containing the express module files).
