Answers
A1. The hardest part of this exercise was getting a firm grasp on the event loop concept.
Though we had some idea on concurrency (through threads in c++), this was a bit different.
The event loop itself made us think differently then what we ever encountered before, this event driven
concept was new for us.
After getting a better understanding we had some cross-platform issues (but it appears that the error was
confined to single machine issue).
A2. The best part of this exercise was the understanding, that js is quite flexible. That is, we might add some
attributes to an existing object on run-time (or even create new function - which is the same in js)
A3.
