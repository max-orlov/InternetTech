TODO:: support HTTP persistence (keep-alive mechanism).


TODO:: We should close the connection only if either:
    TODO:: The version of the HTTP request is 1.0 and there is no ‘Connection: Keep-Alive’ header embedded in that request.
    TODO:: The request contains a ‘Connection: close’ header (you should close the connection only after completion of the response)
    TODO:: Timeout (2 seconds since the last data)


TODO:: To make sure that if something bad happen to the processing of one request it won’t crash the entire server. (DOS)

TODO:: Minimize the number of global javascript variables as possible.

TODO:: Check about mocha in order to test the project (http://taylor.fausak.me/2013/02/17/testing-a-node-js-http-server-with-mocha/)
